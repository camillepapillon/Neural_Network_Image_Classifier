# Neural_Network_Image_Classifier

In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flower. The dataset used to train 
this Neural Netword is from Oxford of 102 flower categories. The model is then be exported to a python application to test different species of flower. 

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

### 1. Load the image dataset and create a pipeline.




### 2. Build and Train an image classifier on this dataset.




### 3. Use the trained model to perform inference on flower images.
